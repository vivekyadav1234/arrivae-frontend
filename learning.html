                         HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, 
                         the code that describes web pages. It's actually three kinds of code: HTML, 
                         which provides the structure; Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which take care of 
                         presentation; and JavaScript, which makes things happen.<a href="html5.html" >learn more</a>

                            JavaScriptÂ® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, 
                            object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known 
                            as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser 
                            environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic,
                             and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.<a href="">learn more</a>

                            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
                             including layout, colors, and fonts.  This separation can improve content accessibility, 
                             provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, 
                             enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, 
                             and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.<a href="">learn more</a>
